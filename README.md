# Personal Portfolio Website
I built my portfolio and completed the FreeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design Certification"

## What I Learned
*With this project I practiced responsiveness and "cleaned" my CSS code.

*I made some scrool animations with JQuery.

*I'm still learning about SEO and I'm using my portfolio to practice.
